				<h3>
					How The Provocative Musician Is Taking New Risks To Build Her Career.
				</h3>

				<p>
					<span><img src="img/letter_m.svg" alt="letter m"></span>iley Cyrus knows how to make a statement. As she lounges on a shag carpet in her Los Angeles basement during a video interview with Forbes, the 29-year-old star reflects on a career that’s taken her from a namesake role in the Disney series Hannah Montana at 13 to her current status as one the top recording artists of her generation.
				</p>

				<div>
					<p>
						“One thing I'm very proud of is that I started my business before I started my period,” says Cyrus. “And now, I’ve performed at Carnegie Hall, Madison Square Garden, inducted Joan Jett into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame—all on my period. It has never gotten in the way of me being a businesswoman.”
					</p>

					<p>
						When most stars talk about career highs, they don’t point out which ones coincided with their menstrual cycle. Then again, they’re not Miley Cyrus. Diehard fans already know Cyrus’ story about how got her first period nearly 15 years ago while performing in white pants on the set of Hannah Montana. She shared the story as a way to connect with fans—she has more than 150 million of them on Instagram alone—not shock them. What could be more emblematic of growing up in the public eye?
					</p>
					<p>
						The series helped Cyrus earn $134 million by the time she hit 18, according to Forbes’ estimates. But it also didn’t define her, as she has since released eight studio albums that range from psychedelic rock to country-hip-hop.
					</p>

					<p>
						Cyrus is now taking more control of her entertainment career and platforms. In May, she struck an estimated $40 million deal with NBCUniversal that brings her back to television with three specials, as well as other projects and first looks at content created by Hopetown Entertainment, her production company with mother Tish Cyrus. She has also partnered with telehealth company Hims & Hers, taking an equity stake and creative role in the Hers skincare line. That’s in addition to a slate of endorsement deals with brands like Gucci, as well as angel investments, new entertainment projects and moves to better control her fan experience with the relaunch of her fan website MileyWorld.
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					“If I know there’s going to be a greater reward by taking a greater risk, usually I’ll do it.” says Cyrus, combing her fingers through her bleached-blonde hair. “I do that with everything—my business, my relationships, with love, with life.”

				<p>
					Like Madonna, whom she considers one of her idols, Cyrus knows how to leverage her raw talent, risk-taking inclination and public persona to keep fans, press and industry executives engaged. For many millennials, memories of Cyrus swinging naked on her “Wrecking Ball” video in 2013 or rubbing up against singer Robin Thicke in a latex bra and panties at the Video Music Awards that year are as integrated into their memories as flared jeans, flip phones and tuning into the Disney Channel to watch Cyrus as Hannah Montana.
				</p>

				<div class="block-text block-text_special">
					<p>
						The outrage certainly helped draw attention to her album Bangerz, which went triple platinum and earned Cyrus her a Grammy nomination, as well as a spot on Forbes 2014 30 Under 30 Music list.
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					After making millions from Bangerz, Cyrus skirted her label and released Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz. A collaboration with Flaming Lips’ frontman Wayne Coyne, she initially published the psychedelic album straight to SoundCloud for fans to hear for free. Rather than stick with a winning formula, she wanted to shake it up.
				</p>

				<div class="block-text block-text_special">
					<p>
						“If I know there’s going to be a greater reward by taking a greater risk, usually I’ll do it.” says Cyrus, combing her fingers through her bleached-blonde hair. “I do that with everything—my business, my relationships, with love, with life.”
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					What drives her is a hardwired love of music. Born to country music star Billy Ray Cyrus and producer Tish Cyrus in Nashville with Dolly Parton as her godmother, Cyrus grew up steeped in the music industry. While some critics dismiss Cyrus as more of a publicity seeker than a singer/songwriter, producer Mark Ronson considers her a rare talent who’s in the same league as other singers he’s worked with, from Amy Winehouse to Lady Gaga. Ronson co-wrote and co-performed what became the triple-platinum song “Nothing Breaks Like a Heart” alongside Cyrus. “She’s so brutally, blatantly honest about her life and, combine that with her voice, that’s why she has over 150 million people worshiping her,” says Ronson. “All the great ones, especially the really big ones, they’ve got their pain out there for the world to see.”
				</p>

				<div class="block-text block-text_special">
					<p>
						Cyrus certain shares her pain. She has talked about feeling exploited at times and is open about her struggles with anxiety, depression, alcohol and drug use. She lost her Malibu home to a wildfire in 2018 and her short-lived marriage to longtime beau Liam Hemsworth a year later. Within days of announcing her breakup, she was photographed kissing actress Kaitlynn Carter. Cyrus later declared herself to be pansexual or attracted to people regardless of their sex or gender identity.
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					These days Cyrus presents a more introspective and tranquil version of herself, experimenting with music and philanthropy rather than drugs and partying. Queer causes, displacement and her enormous platform inspired her to start Happy Hippie Foundation in 2015 to provide education, employment and support services to homeless and at-risk LGBTQ+ youth. “People are going to talk about me: What can I get them to talk about that actually makes a difference?” asks Cyrus. “People talking about me dressing up as a teddy bear and shaking my ass doesn’t do anything. Starting Happy Hippie, and it being around six years later, has been the proudest moment of my career.”
				</p>

				<p>
					The pandemic also brought her back to the world of TV. In March of 2020, she started the Instagram Live series “Bright Minded,” in which she chatted with guests like Elton John and Senator Elizabeth Warren while featuring pets, makeup tutorials and a spotlight on social causes. In May of this year, she announced a deal with NBCUniversal for three specials and other potential projects that Forbes estimates to be worth $40 million. First out of the gate: NBC Peacock’s first-ever Pride special that promoted LGBTQ+ causes, along with Cyrus singing a rendition of Cher’s “Believe” in a sequin outfit, flanked by drag queens. All of this helped Cyrus earn a spot in the <mark>Forbes</mark> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2022/hall-of-fame" target="_blank" class="color-link color-link_article">Under 30 Hall of Fame</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					While Cyrus is still not shy, these days fans are more likely to see her showing off her spotless skin in ads for telehealth company Hims & Hers as part of a deal that gives her an equity stake and creative role in the Hers skincare line than twerking. That’s in addition to a slate of endorsement deals with brands like Gucci, as well as angel investments in companies like Fanmade, an agency cofounded by her marketing and digital head (and fellow <mark>Forbes</mark> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/olivia-rudensky/?sh=3a06e14c6987" class="color-link color-link_article" target="_blank">30 Under 30</a>) Olivia Rudensky. Among other things, Cyrus wants to build out a direct-to-fan site that keeps the trolls and tech billionaires from profiting from her following. That means investing in MileyWorld, the fan site her mother started during her Disney days to create a safe space for Cyrus to engage with her audience. Content ideas range from adding everything from Miley-guided meditation to exclusive performance videos. “I want to have my own land,” says Cyrus. “I want people to know they are in the power position with these platforms—platforms are not in the power position; we’re taking the power back.”
				</p>
				<p>
					For Cyrus, the most important piece of land these days is the one in her front yard that’s home to the Airstream trailer where records her music. If the shag-covered basement is where she focuses on building the brand, the trailer is where she feeds her soul, creating and recording new music, including her 2020 rock album Plastic Hearts. It’s a place she goes every day and one that she guards for herself. When asked what musical genre she is exploring at the moment, Cyrus will only say, “I love the soft side of rock that is more vulnerable.” Whether that will result in music that skews more to her country or rock instincts is, of course, up to her. She’ll create on her own time—and on her own terms. “I’m happy to be all the things that people need me to be,” says Cyrus. “As long as I’m all the things that I need me to be first.”

						Miley Cyrus explodes into the room in a black Saint Laurent slip dress, a two-foot Gucci beefeater-style hat on her head.
					</p>
					<p>
						“Is it sickening,” she demands rhetorically, her delicious southern rasp familiar in a way only a squillion light years of celebrity living can make it. In her thrall, festooned around the suite on the 33rd floor of The Ritz-Carlton New York, NoMad, sit her travelling chorus of creatives, the indispensable “comfort blanket” of five men who embody the sort of modern Hollywood bohemia she adores, and who accordingly she goes everywhere with. They offer consensus: yes. Just to be sure she struts the room wall-to-wall, eyes darting.

						Cyrus – now 30 (how is she only 30?), with several lifetimes of glory, nonsense, trauma and good times under her belt – is in showgirl mode. For the moment, at least. My word, she’s a gas. “What is with this art?” she asks hammily between poses, offended by some neutral swirls in a picture frame. Then she catches sight of herself on the iPhone screen of Stephen Galloway, acclaimed choreographer and her friend. “It’s giving Pam Tillis,” she decrees, patting the towering fluffy black helmet to the delight of her troop, before launching into a funny, gossipy tale about said Pam, the bouffanted country singer, who she met recently and who asked her to pass her best on to Cyrus’s godmother, Dolly Parton, which she dutifully did. Parton sweetly replied, “Oh, Pam, I haven’t seen her in years.”
					</p>
					<p>
						“But thennn,” says Cyrus, tingling with delight, “I went on to Pam’s Instagram and what do you know? There’s a photo of her with Dolly [taken recently]! Country shade,” she declares of her beloved Dolly: “You can’t beat it.” She dives on to the bed next to me, shaking out her bleachy, rooty, sexy hair. Fear not. The monologue keeps going: “Dinosaur dust art”; “These earrings are not it”; “Am I going on tour? Yeah, the Aman hotel tour. Singing in the lobby for that complimentary massage.”
					</p>

					<p>
						To wit: a gas. Although you can’t help noticing it takes close to 20 minutes for Cyrus to sustain eye contact that lasts longer than a second. She is, seemingly, not a person who takes joy in the novelty of strangers, who doesn’t trust them right away. Frankly, why should she?
					</p>
					<p>
						But while the initial energy is remote and flighty, it takes absolutely no time at all to become riveted by her. Astonishingly famous since her early teens, hers is a fate perhaps only understood by a handful of people during mass media’s relatively short history. One’s reductive first instinct is to interpret her thrilling lack of chill as toxic-media-induced, post-child-stardom neurosis. But she is having none of that.
					</p>
					<p>
						The shopworn narrative of a famous woman’s survival and triumph? “So f**king basic.” Some time later, when it’s only us chatting, she says, “One thing I wouldn’t want this story to become is a complaint of being a woman in the industry. I don’t need this to be a women’s empowerment story. I wear my empowerment at all times. I don’t need to profess it.”

					<p>
						In truth, she is sage, witty and unpredictable, prone to find the whole machinery of fame ridiculous and damaging – especially for women. She is essentially done with engaging or even talking about the whole rodeo. Certainly in trad media terms. “Why would I do British Vogue?” she wonders aloud at one point later, just the two of us on a sofa. “Why would I even do an interview?” She seems genuinely curious to have found herself here.
					</p>
					<p>
						Well, real talk. She was dying to be photographed by Steven Meisel. She also happens to be enjoying one of the most successful years of her career as a musician, to say nothing of her arrival at a new fashion peak, thanks to a fabulous run of vintage looks at her New Year’s Eve special for American network television, and a smattering of judicious appearances, including at the Versace runway show in LA in the days before the Oscars (an absolute fashion nut, she is quick to credit her beloved personal stylist Bradley Kenneth’s hand in her current era of killer looks).

						Then there is “Flowers”. At the time of writing, the song – an addictive comeback single that has made its way to instant classic status – has spent eight weeks at the top of the US Billboard charts, with another 10 consecutive at No1 in the UK. In early May it became the fastest song in the history of Spotify to clock up a billion streams. Released in January, at this point its staying power is so remarkable it seems in danger of becoming the song of the summer. Who knows. Given the album is called Endless Summer Vacation – which, for Miley, is as much lifestyle mantra as record title – perhaps it will?
					</p>
					<p>
						She achieved her latest internet-smashing moment despite doing next to no press. A boss move. Instead, she tossed the song out into the world and let social media eat itself alive. Are the lyrics of self-care and personal triumph (“I can love me better than you can”) a direct riposte to her ex-husband, the Australian actor Liam Hemsworth? Did the video, with more than 435 million views on YouTube (and counting), exquisitely directed by Jacob Bixenman, with nods to Helmut Newton and Michael Mann, really feature Cyrus wearing one of Hemsworth’s old tux jackets?

					<p>
						She has no time for any of this. “I never need to be a master at the craft of tricking an audience,” she says, shrugging. “It will set itself on fire all by itself.” Rather than an explicit diary of her experience, she says she simply wanted to make a song that she could do with hearing. “I wrote it in a really different way. The chorus was originally: ‘I can buy myself flowers, write my name in the sand, but I can’t love me better than you can.’ It used to be more, like, 1950s. The saddest song. Like: ‘Sure, I can be my own lover, but you’re so much better,’” she says. In the end she rejected the gloom. “The song is a little fake it till you make it,” she says. “Which I’m a big fan of.”
					</p>
					<p>
						She immediately sensed it was a hit – “I’ve been doing this for a while” – and so the night of the release she went out dancing with her crew at the Sunset club at The West Hollywood Edition. “I’m sober. I don’t drink, I don’t… you know, but I celebrate. It’s like one o’clock in the morning and Lil Nas X walks into the club and he asks me the most interesting question. He said: ‘Are you so anxious about how successful ‘Flowers’ is?’”
					</p>
					<p>
						She thinks about it again now. “I was like, ‘No. I might be No1 now, but No2 is on its way.’ Everything is seasonal,” she says, her grey-blue eyes finally alighting on mine. She thinks we all need to be more honest about the false god of unfluctuating success – even pop stars. “A lot of headlines [recently] have said, ‘This is Miley’s moment.’ And I’m like, ‘That’s exactly what it is. It’s a moment. And it will be over.’”
					</p>
					<p>
						“That’s not pessimistic,” she continues, smiling. “That’s honest and that’s OK with me. I actually prefer it. I don’t like to stay big.” When Endless Summer Vacation was released she wasn’t even in LA and didn’t have her phone with her. “My boyfriend brings his phone and I don’t bring one. I had no way of knowing what number it would [chart at], and it wasn’t of importance to me because it wouldn’t have changed anything. Someone could say, ‘It would be this number if you did that, or this number if you sell your soul…’” She shrugs again. “I’ve been in the Garden of Eden before and I’ve taken the red apple, and it never feels good.”

					<p>
						So here we are. Miley’s first sit-down interview in some time and she’ll be damned if she’s going to sell herself to me or you. She knows what that game looks like too well. I’m not sure anyone who didn’t achieve global prominence in the entertainment industry as a teen in the distinct quagmire of Noughties media could understand it better. First, of course, came Hannah Montana in 2006. The crazily successful Disney show, in which she played a teenage pop star with a double life, became such a phenomenon that she ended up selling out stadiums around the world in minutes (the Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert becoming the highest-selling concert film of all time). A daughter of country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, she has been managed by her adored mother Tish since day one, while her adolescent life was a truly head-spinning mix of standard Tennessee home life plus superstar day job, with a top note of prurient, morally muddled public interest in her coming of age that was, even at the time, distinctly gross.
					</p>
					<p>
						It certainly sounds like too much for a person to handle, but I will say it’s made Cyrus incredibly smart. She is unique among anyone I’ve interviewed in her assessment of fame; she is almost Neo-esque in her ability to see the green code of the matrix around her. “I’m actually not an attention-seeking person, sitting here as a 30-year-old grown woman,” she says. Miley’s aware that her explosion into early adulthood, whether riding naked on a demolition ball in the video for “Wrecking Ball” or her twerk-tastic performance at the 2013 MTV Music Video Awards, still occupies space in the public consciousness. “I was creating attention for myself because I was dividing myself from a character I had played. Anyone, when you’re 20 or 21, you have more to prove. ‘I’m not my parents.’ ‘I am who I am.’”

						She is movingly even-natured when she goes on to describe the fallout: “I carried some guilt and shame around myself for years because of how much controversy and upset I really caused,” she says. “Now that I’m an adult, I realise how harshly I was judged. I was harshly judged as a child by adults and now, as an adult, I realise that I would never harshly judge a child.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Her tone is that of a person who has processed her fury. But wow. Sometimes she laughs about it. A friend asked her for some skincare advice recently and in a joking response she sent them a story a tabloid magazine ran a decade ago in which they’d highlighted her acne and gone with the headline: “A Breakout Year!” Jesus. “Right? Like who thought that I was not a person who would be hurt by that? Like I was clearly a 20-year-old girl. Sure, at 20 I was like every 20-year-old. You think you’re grown, but now I’m like, ‘Oh, no, I was fully a kid.’” She still gets weirded out by what she sees published about herself. “I was reading this thing the other day about women in the industry who don’t have children and I was on the list,” she says, alongside the likes of Helen Mirren, Oprah Winfrey and Dolly. Her takeaway? She’s done trying to tool her statements or make life choices that are about making everyone happy.
					</p>
					<p>
						Interestingly, for someone with more than 207 million Instagram followers, this extends to her fans. Don’t get her wrong. She’s grateful. But says she can’t live her life for them anymore. She loves an audience but not in the way she grew up on. “Look, the kiki follows me everywhere that I go,” she says of Galloway, Bixenman and Kenneth, as well as Bob Recine and James Kaliardos (her personal hair and make-up team), all of whom are kicking around today. “I love performing but pretty much for them,” she says, smiling. “Like singing for hundreds of thousands of people isn’t really the thing that I love. There’s no connection. There’s no safety.” I guess it’s pretty hard to people-please 100,000 individuals simultaneously? “Right,” she says, nodding. “It’s also not natural. It’s so isolating because if you’re in front of 100,000 people then you are alone.”
